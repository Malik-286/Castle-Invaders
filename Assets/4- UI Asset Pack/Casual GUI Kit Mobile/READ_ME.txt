Thanks for purchasing this asset!


The source files for this GIU Kit you can find in: Assets/hardartcore/Casual GUI Kit Mobile/Source Files directory.
Since the whole project is based on vector graphics, both source files which are included are for Figma & Sketch apps.

Figma: https://www.figma.com/

Sketch: https://www.sketch.com

The whole GUI Kit was build using Sketch, but you should have any issues with Figma too, it was already tested using it.


There are a few script files which are included with this pack which just show a simple way of interaction with some UI elements.
The scripts are using Dotween plugin which is free in Asset Store and can be downloaded from here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dotween-hotween-v2-27676
